# Functional Programming Lectures

A comprehensive curriculum for mastering functional programming with TypeScript and Redux. This repository contains a structured series of lectures designed to take you from the basics of pure functions to advanced architectural patterns used in modern scalable applications.

**[Start Learning Here (Curriculum Index)](./index.md)**

## Learning Path

The curriculum is organized into five main sections:

1.  **Fundamentals**: Core concepts of TypeScript, pure functions, and functional programming basics.
2.  **Intermediate**: Modern Redux patterns, Redux Toolkit, and functional composition.
3.  **Advanced**: Monads, monad transformers, and category theory fundamentals.
4.  **Applications**: Real-world applications, performance optimization, and cross-language FP.
5.  **Maintenance & Architecture**: Strategies for maintaining large FP codebases and modern Redux architecture.

## Real-World Application

These functional programming patterns are used in production at **[ForbocAI](https://forboc.ai)** — a neuro-symbolic AI SDK for autonomous game NPCs. The SDK uses Redux-style state management, pure functional pipelines, and monadic patterns for AI inference.
