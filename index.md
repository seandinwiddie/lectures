# Functional Programming Lectures

## Overview
This series of lectures explores functional programming concepts from fundamentals to advanced applications in modern development. The curriculum is designed with a **lean and modular approach**, emphasizing **separation of concerns** and **functional programming principles** throughout. As you progress, you'll learn how to build maintainable, scalable applications using pure functions, immutable data structures, and modern state management (this is crucial) architecture patterns.

**Key Learning Philosophy:**
- **Functions for Everything**: Every concept is taught through the lens of pure functions
- **Immutability First**: Learn to work with immutable data structures from day one
- **Type Safety**: Learn to use types to their full potential
- **Side Effects at the Edges**: Learn to isolate effects at boundaries and keep core logic pure
- **Composition Over Complexity**: Build complex systems from simple, composable parts
- **Redux Toolkit Priority**: RTK and RTK Query are the definitive choice for state management and data fetching
- **Lean Architecture**: Focus on small, focused files with clear separation of concerns

**Architecture Principles You'll Learn:**
- **Lean and Modular Codebase**: Avoid unnecessary code, duplication, or bloat
- **Separation of Concerns**: UI components focus on rendering, Redux slices handle business logic
- **Multiple Command Dispatchers**: Different handlers for different domains
- **Small, Focused Files**: Preferably one function per file for clarity and testability
- **Boilerplate vs. Business Logic**: Keep setup code separate from core application rules
- **Avoid Over-Centralization**: Distribute feature business logic; centralize only cross-cutting infrastructure

> "All software design is composition: the act of breaking complex problems down into smaller problems and composing those solutions. Learn to do it well." - Eric Elliott

## Typescript

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language.

TypeScript will be the language of choice for this course.

## Programming Glossary

- **expression**: A piece of code that produces a value. Expressions can be evaluated and always return a result (e.g., `2 + 3`, `Math.max(a, b)`, `user.name`).

- **statement**: A complete instruction that performs an action. Statements don't return values but execute code (e.g., `if (condition) { ... }`, `return value;`, `const x = 5;`).

- **declaration**: Code that introduces a new variable, function, or type into scope. Declarations create bindings but don't necessarily execute code.

- **assignment**: The process of storing a value in a variable. In functional programming, assignments are often avoided in favor of immutable declarations.

- **variable**: A named container that stores a value. In functional programming, variables are often immutable to prevent side effects and ensure referential transparency.

- **const**: A variable that is immutable. In functional programming, variables should be immutable to prevent side effects and ensure referential transparency. `const` is a better choice than `let` because it's more explicit and less error-prone.

- **gate**: A logical operator that controls data flow (AND, OR, NOT). Gates are pure functions that combine boolean values.

- **boolean**: A data type with only two possible values: true or false. Booleans are fundamental to conditional logic and functional programming.

- **number**: A numeric data type for mathematical operations. In functional programming, numbers are immutable and operations return new values.

- **string**: A sequence of characters representing text. Strings are immutable in most functional programming contexts.

- **array**: An ordered collection of elements. Arrays are fundamental to functional programming for data transformation operations.

- **object**: A collection of key-value pairs representing a real-world entity. In functional programming, objects should be immutable.

- **method**: A function that belongs to an object or class. Methods can access the object's state and modify it (though this is avoided in functional programming).

- **function**: A reusable block of code that takes inputs (parameters) and returns an output. In functional programming, functions should be pure - same input always produces same output with no side effects.

- **type**: A classification of data that defines what operations can be performed on it. Types provide compile-time safety and documentation.

- **argument**: The actual value passed to a function when it's called. Arguments are the concrete data that functions operate on.

- **parameter**: The placeholder variable in a function definition that receives arguments. Parameters define the function's interface and expected input types.

- **attribute**: A property or characteristic of an object. In functional programming, object attributes should be immutable to prevent side effects.

- **return**: A statement that exits a function and provides a value back to the caller. Return values should be the only way functions communicate results.

- **side effect**: Any change to the system outside the function (modifying global state, making API calls, logging). Pure functions avoid side effects.

- **event**: A signal that something has happened in the system (user interaction, timer completion, data arrival). Events are the foundation of reactive programming.

- **listener**: A function that waits for and responds to events. Listeners are pure functions that process event data without side effects.

- **handler**: A function that processes a specific event or action. Handlers should be pure functions that transform input data into output data.

- **callback**: A function passed as an argument to another function, to be executed later. Callbacks enable asynchronous programming and function composition.

- **promise**: An object representing the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation. Promises provide a clean way to handle async operations functionally.

- **async/await**: Syntactic sugar for working with promises. Async functions return promises, and await pauses execution until a promise resolves.

- **symbol**: A unique, immutable primitive value used as object property keys. Symbols provide a way to create truly private properties.

- **null**: A special value representing the intentional absence of any object value. In functional programming, null is often replaced with Maybe/Option types.

- **undefined**: A value assigned to variables that have been declared but not initialized. Undefined represents an unassigned value.

- **NaN**: "Not a Number" - a special numeric value representing an undefined or unrepresentable mathematical result.

- **interface**: A TypeScript construct that defines the shape of an object. Interfaces describe contracts that objects must fulfill.

- **class**: A blueprint for creating objects with shared properties and methods. Classes are less common in functional programming, which prefers plain objects and functions.

- **set**: A collection of unique values with no duplicates. Sets are useful for functional programming operations like union, intersection, and difference.

- **loop**: A control structure that repeats code execution. In functional programming, loops are often replaced with higher-order functions like map, filter, and reduce.

- **condition**: A boolean expression that determines program flow. Conditions are used in if statements and ternary operators.

- **iteration**: The process of repeating a set of instructions. In functional programming, iteration is handled through recursion or higher-order functions.

- **recursion**: A function calling itself to solve a problem by breaking it into smaller subproblems. Recursion is fundamental to functional programming.
